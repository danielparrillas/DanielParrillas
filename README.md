### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on a ticketing system for El Salvador's Protected Natural Areas with tourist services.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning the use of web maps. Check out my first test at https://danielparrillas.github.io/sgg-espacios-recreativos/.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: daniel16parrillas@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fact: I love working on full-stack projects with JavaScript, especially when paired with TypeScript. However, I was required to work with PHP at my job, so I had to learn it. Nevertheless, I found the best way to complement it with one of my favorite technologies, React.js. Take a look at how it turned out: https://github.com/DanielParrillas/modulo-reservaciones.
